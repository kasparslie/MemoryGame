    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Hello, and welcome, to our page, this page was created by aspiring developers in training at Wild Code School in Amsterdam.
    This project is our first time project in web development deploying combination of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and DOM manipulations in order
    to achieve expected functionality.
    For project management we used www.trello.com, for project mock up we used www.figma.com. Then rest of the file structure and script was created using 
    Visual Code Studio and GIT for files management and collaboration.</p>
