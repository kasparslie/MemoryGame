    <h2>Memory Game Rules</h2>
    <p>find the rules for the famous Memory game, know as Concentration card game or Matching Game.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the game, all the cards are mixed up and laid in rows, face down on the table.</p>
        
    <p>Player 1 starts and turns over two cards:</p>
        
    <p>If the cards don’t match (it’s not a pair), he turns them back over and it’s then the turn of player 2 to turn over two new cards.</p>
    <p>However, if the two cards match, it’s a pair! He keeps the cards and has the right to play again...</p>
        
    <p>When the players have found all the pairs, the game is over. The player who has the most cards wins!</p>
